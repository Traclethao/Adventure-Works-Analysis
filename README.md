Using Power BI to visualize dashboards about the business's purchasing situation. 
## **I. Introduction**

- AdventureWorks database supports standard online transaction processing scenarios for a fictitious bicycle manufacturer - Adventure Works Cycles. Scenarios include Manufacturing, Sales, Purchasing, Product Management, Contact Management, and Human Resources.
- The purchasing department will be responsible for purchasing goods, raw materials, and semi-finished products for production. Management expects that the goods ordered are sufficient for sales, on time, and at optimal import prices.
- The dataset includes a **dim table** containing information about product and vendor, including fields of **product** information (ID, name, category, and subcategory) and information related to the **vendor** (ID, name, price, leadtime).
